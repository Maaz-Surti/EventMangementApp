# EventMangementApp
It is a app to create and view your created events.
I have used Core Data to store and retrieve the files locally.
The purpose of this project is to grasp the concepts of Core Data by 
creating, updating and deleting the entities and properties in the database 
as well as learning the ins and outs of table view.
